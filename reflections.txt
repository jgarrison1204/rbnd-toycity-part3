
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
	Probably spent about 8 hours working on this project. That includes research....and more research. 

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
	Gaining a baseline understanding of how to manipulate objects.
	I think, I understand how objects can be inserted into arrays, how to loop through those objects and call methods native to each object. 
	
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
	1. I added an item_id for each product.  As a product base grows we'd want to autoincrement as new products arrive and have the unique id be an integer.
	2. Created the self.find_by_name method in the transaction class.  This method allows employees to search for a customers last transaction by name. 
	   When dealing with a customer inquiry we'd probably want a way to quickly access their last transaction by name.


4. Where do you still have room to grow?
	Everywhere. lol.
